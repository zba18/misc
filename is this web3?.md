## what the hell is the hype about web3? heres how i now make sense of it.

### i guess start off from the beginning. here's the basic idea.

web3 is a movement where we use a new set of technologies to change (and hopefully improve) the way we do things. the main, unifying, new thing web3 sets out to do is create an all-in-one digital world to exist in, in parallel to our physical world. think TRON, or maybe Genshin Impact, except you can actually do things in the *physical world*, using our *digital self*. just like in a game, this digital self can buy, own, and sell things. it can even MAKE things from scratch.

### N-F-T? sorry... W-T-F?
imagine your digital self own sa special, limited edition piece of armor in a game. imagine back in real life, people have limited-access, INVITE-ONLY events for digital people with that special armor you have. now thats some clout. thats what the crazy hype about NFTs was. thats an example of what web3 allows, regarding the art scene. 

### why web THREE? what were web2 and web1?
so as mentioned, in web3 you can own things digitally. you have an account, and you have things. sound familiar? its just like having fb, ig, twitter, etc etc. you have posts, comments, likes, etc. linked to your account. they are YOURS. or are they? well not really. technically, fb, ig, and twitter are the ones who own that data, and they are simply associated to you because you made an account. in web2, big tech companies store your data in exchange for a (controlled) streamlined, ad-filled experience. which sounds like a terrible trade, but still has many perks compared to 'web1'. what people consider as web1 is like wikipedia, news sites, and your friends' blogs. sure theres a lot of stuff there, especially when you click around all the links in all the pages, but would you know which website to open when you're completely exhausted after a long day of work? no. 

while web1 is a really quite a 'web' of data, web2 is the aggregation of data into a more integrated, social, useful in a real-world way. bear in mind this is done because companies store and aggregate (ALGORITHMS go BRRRR), and provide services for you with your data.

### wtf does blockchain have to do with this all?
well blockchain for the uninformed, is just like a really, really, REALLY long (unlimited actually) piece of paper. you can put whatever you want on it. store any random piece of info you may want. store any bits of data you want. its basically infinite data storage. wait... does that sound familar? storing data? no? well imagine if the entirety of instagram was stored on just one really big harddrive. everyones pictures, accounts, comments, everything. thats what how web3 uses the blockchain. all your digital-self-data. everyone's digital-selves, stored on a SHARED, BIG, LONG, PIECE OF PAPER. best part of all??!! zuckerbergs hands arent all over it!! 

### decentralized governance...? woah hold up wtf.
so we have a big long piece of paper where everyone's digital selves are stored. neat. what can you do with that though? great question. surprisingly, quite a lot. 

imagine for a second youre talking to your friend and he asks you for some money. you tell him "bro, you never pay me back, no way", and he goes "yes i do, when did i not?". you obviously go "oh that one time.. uh. uh... like.. i dont fucking remember but u didnt pay me back". maybe if you guys had written all your transactions down like lowkey parasocial weirdos you would be able to judge whether or not your friend is trustworthy. but you didnt. so you just have to guess. 

now imagine instead of a friend, its a complete stranger -- you have to guess even more. BUT if for some reason that stranger had a record of all their interactions with others written on some BIG LONG PIECE OF PAPER, you could actually very easily decide if you can trust them. 

but honestly why stop there? if someone can be trusted money, they can perhaps be trusted with more. good citizens should have a right to a good life, and a say in the decisions of their government, right? well in a world where everyone;s records are clear to see (because theyre written on the paper), theres potentially so much you could do. run a business, run a club, run an organization, hell, maybe you should even be allowed to decide how the damn piece of paper itself works. how DIGITAL SOCIETY works.
